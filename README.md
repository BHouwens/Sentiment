# Sentiment

Supervised sentiment analysing system. Resources need to be pickled (namely your feature sets) and classifiers are assumed to be pretrained (I've used Pickle for this in the examples and specific analysers as well).

## Stuff You Need

- Python 3.x
- Sklearn
- NLTK

## Election

The `election.py` is a module that acts like a decision tree for pretrained classifiers. There's nothing unusual about it, other than maybe the naming convention.
